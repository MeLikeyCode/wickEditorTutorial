# wickEditorTutorial
Save file for the zombie shooter that I present in a Wick editor (tool for creating interactive web apps) tutorial I made.

To load the file, just click `file` -> `open project` in the Wick editor and select my save file.

To run the game, click `run`.

Here is a link to the video tutorial showing you
  1 - A demo of the zombie shooter I made.
  2 - A somewhat quick (~30 minute) tutorial showing you how to make the basics of the game in the Wick editor.
  
 The Wick editor makes it *extremely* easy to create interactive web apps and it is very, *very* fun to use! I highly recommend it.
